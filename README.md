IOT device for water monitoring (King Saud University)

In this project , we are focusing on continuous and real time monitoring of water
using IOT platform.Water supply with continuous monitoring allow us to have a
record of available amount of water .
The system consists of ESP8266 microcontroller (include WI-FI module) ,waterflow sensor, water pump and water tank .

The aim of this project, which is monitoring of water flowing in a home tank using IOT platform.
The system use flow meter to measure the water flow which is frequently sent to
MQTT cloud using an IOT board based on ESP8266 microcontroller through the
built in Wi-Fi module. Then getting this data from Cloud to mobile application, the
application used to view and monitor the amount of water used and generate bill
for water usage, also the mobile application can control the pump operation by ON
OFF switch.
The monitoring can be done from anywhere remotely using internet of things so we
can see the data in real time operation in efficient way.
